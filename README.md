# TeX Projects

## On matrices and linear transformations
It was my first TeX project on the correlation between matrices and linear transformations. My goal was to compile my knowledge about this topic, which I gained by adding into what I had already seen in my Linear Algebra classes, into a proper format. It was way harder than i expected (for example, trying to find the best order of everything, ensuring that all of it is rigorous enough and has proper formatting), but I made good progress in the TeX language as a result of my efforts, and achieved a relatively good outcome.
