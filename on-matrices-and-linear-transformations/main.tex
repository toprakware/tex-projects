    \begin{abstract}
        Everyone who has taken an introductory level linear algebra course should
        be aware of the correlation between matrices and linear transformations.
        In this paper, which should be viewed as an educational resource rather
        than an academic paper with groundbreaking original ideas, we aim to
        approach to this correlation in a way that is as formal (consequently
        nonsense) as possible, and define the matrix associated with a linear
        transformation together with proving the isomorphism between
        $\transfs{V}{W}$, the space of linear transformations from $V$ to $W$
        where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces over a field $\F$ with $\dim{V} = n$
        and $\dim{W} = m$; and $\matrices$, the space of $m \times n$ matrices
        with coefficients in $\F$. The prerequisites to read this paper are just
        having taken an introductory linear algebra course and basic familiarity
        with some fundamental mathematical notations.
